wxPerl from Mattia Barbon and Mark Dootson has stalled since 2017.

This is an independent fork. It is created for my own purposes,
because I need a reliable Wx platform on Linux, Microsoft Windows, and
Apple macOS. I will add features that I need. PRs for other features
are welcome.

The roadmap includes support for newer versions of Perl and wxWidgets.

The roadmap also includes dropping support for Perl older than 5.26
and wxWidgets older than 3.0.
