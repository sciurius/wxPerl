wxPerl is a wrapper built around the wxWindows GUI toolkit

Copyright (c) 2000 Mattia Barbon.
This package is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the same terms as Perl itself.

You need wxWindows in order to build wxPerl (see http://www.wxwindows.org/).
At this moment you may only use GTK or Win32 as windowing toolkits.

INSTALLATION:

When you have built and installed wxWindows, do

perl Makefile.PL   # (1)
make               # (2)
make test          # (3)
make install

1) this step will output the compilation flags derived from
   wxWindows (for debugging purpouses)
2) under Windows you may need to use nmake, or another *make
3) you may also want to do
   perl run minimal
   perl run controls
   ...
   against the samples in the 'samples' subdirectory
   before installing
